** Explore the Monitoring Data
Once the stack is running, you can explore the collected metrics and
logs:

1. Access Grafana at [[http://localhost:3000]] (default credentials are
   admin/admin)
2. Import the Node Exporter dashboard to visualize system metrics:
   - Go to Dashboards → Import
   - Upload the JSON file from
     [[https://grafana.com/api/dashboards/1860/revisions/37/download][here]]
   - Select the Prometheus data source and click Import
3. Access Grafana Alloy UI at http://localhost:12345

This community dashboard provides comprehensive system metrics including
CPU, memory, disk, and network usage.

** Viewing Logs
Open your browser and go to
[[http://localhost:3000/a/grafana-lokiexplore-app]]. This will take you
to the Loki explorer in Grafana.

** Configuration Customization
The included =config.alloy= file sets up:

1. Node Exporter integration to collect system metrics
2. Log collection from system logs and journal
3. Relabeling rules to organize metrics and logs
4. Remote write endpoints for Prometheus and Loki

You can customize which collectors are enabled/disabled and adjust
scrape intervals in the configuration file.

** Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues:
- Check container logs: =kubectl logs -n observability daemonset/alloy=
- Verify Alloy is running: =kubectl get pods -n observability=
- Ensure ports are not conflicting with existing services
- Review the Alloy configuration in =config.alloy=
